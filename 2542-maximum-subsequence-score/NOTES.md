* Let's analyze the time complexity of this code.
​
* Sorting nums2 takes O(n log n), where n is the length of nums2.
* Sorting nums1 takes O(m log m), where m is the length of nums1.
* Initializing the visited set (vis) takes O(1).
* The loop iterating over n2 has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of nums2.
* Within the loop, the condition if i not in vis and the subsequent operations take O(1) time.
* The while loop inside the main loop has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the length of nums1.
* The maximum subsequence score calculation and the decrement of cnt and tot take O(1) time.
* The final return statement is also executed in O(1) time.
* Combining these time complexities, the overall time complexity of the code is O((n + m) log m), where n is the length of nums2 and m is the length of nums1.
*
* It's important to note that this analysis assumes that the sorting operations dominate the time complexity, as the input size is not explicitly mentioned. Additionally, the time complexity may vary depending on the implementation details of the Python interpreter.
​
* Let's analyze the space complexity of the code:
*
* The space used by the n2 variable, which stores the sorted version of nums2, is O(n), where n is the length of nums2.
* The space used by the n1 variable, which stores the sorted version of nums1, is O(m), where m is the length of nums1.
* The space used by the vis set is at most O(m), as it can store the indexes of all elements in nums1.
* The tot, ans, cnt, and j variables require constant space.
* There are no other significant space-consuming data structures or variables.
* Therefore, the overall space complexity of the code is O(max(n, m)), where n is the length of nums2 and m is the length of nums1.
