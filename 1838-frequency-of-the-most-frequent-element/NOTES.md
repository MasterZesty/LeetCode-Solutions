## Intuition
**The goal is to maximize the frequency of an element by performing at most k operations, where each operation increments an element at a chosen index by 1. Sorting the array helps in creating a sequence that maximizes the frequency.**
​
## Approach
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Use two pointers, i and j, to create a sliding window.
3. Maintain a sum variable to track the sum of elements within the window.
4. Increment i and adjust the window until the difference between the total sum and the sum within the window is less than or equal to k.
5. Keep track of the maximum window length, which represents the maximum frequency.
​
## Complexity
* Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the length of the array nums.
* Space Complexity: O(1) as we use a constant amount of space.
