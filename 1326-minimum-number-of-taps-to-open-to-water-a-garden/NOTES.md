Of course! The statement "For each index from left to right, update the value at that index with the maximum of its current value and right" refers to the process of updating the `max_range` array during the algorithm. Here's a breakdown of what this step means:
​
1. **Index Range**: The algorithm calculates the leftmost and rightmost points that can be watered by the tap at a specific index `i`. The range that the tap can cover is `[left, right]`, where `left` and `right` are calculated based on the tap's position and its given range.
​
2. **Updating Values**: For each index `j` within the range `[left, right]`, the algorithm performs an update on the `max_range` array. Specifically, it checks whether the current value at index `j` in the `max_range` array is less than `right`, which represents the farthest rightmost point that can be reached by the current tap. If the current value is indeed less, it updates the value at index `j` with the value of `right`. This step ensures that the `max_range` array correctly stores the maximum rightmost point that can be reached by any tap.
​
3. **Maximum Value**: The reason for using the maximum of the current value and `right` is to make sure that you retain the farthest point that can be reached by multiple taps. If there are overlapping coverage areas of different taps, you want to store the maximum coverage for that particular index.
​
In summary, this step ensures that the `max_range` array accumulates the maximum coverage information for each tap, allowing you to determine the overall coverage provided by multiple taps.
