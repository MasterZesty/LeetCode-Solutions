Space complexity:
​
The space complexity is dominated by the hmap dictionary, which stores the frequency of each element in nums. The dictionary will have at most n entries, where n is the length of the nums list. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
The q list stores tuples of frequency-value pairs. In the worst case, it can have up to n elements (when all elements in nums are unique). Hence, the space complexity of the q list is also O(n).
The ans list stores the top k frequent elements, which can have a maximum length of k. Therefore, the space complexity of the ans list is O(k).
Overall, the space complexity of the code is O(n + k).
​
Time complexity:
​
Counting the frequency of elements in nums takes O(n) time, as each element needs to be processed once.
Building the q list by iterating over the hmap dictionary takes O(n) time, as there can be at most n elements in hmap.
Sorting the q list using the sort() method takes O(n log n) time in the worst case, where n is the length of the q list.
Retrieving the top k elements from the q list takes O(k) time since the pop(0) operation is used k times.
Overall, the time complexity of the code is O(n + n log n + k), which can be simplified to O(n log n) if k is much smaller than n.
In summary, the space complexity is O(n + k), and the time complexity is O(n log n) in most cases.
