### Triangular Numbers
​
`The triangular number sequence is the representation of the numbers in the form of equilateral triangle arranged in a series or sequence. These numbers are in a sequence of 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and so on. The numbers in the triangular pattern are represented by dots. The sum of the previous number and the order of succeeding number results in the sequence of triangular numbers. We will learn more here in this article.`

### List Of Triangular Numbers
​
0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120,136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406, 435, 465, 496, 528, 561, 595, 630, 666, 703, 741, 780, 820, 861, 903, 946, 990, 1035, 1081, 1128, 1176, 1225, 1275, 1326, 1378, 1431, and so on.

Sum of Triangular Numbers
In the pattern of triangular numbers you will see, the next number in the sequence is added with an extra row. Let us explain in detail.
​
First number is 1
In number 2,  a row is added with two dots to the first number
In number 3, a row is added with three dots to the second number
Again, in number 4, a row is added with four dots to the third number and so on
So the sequence formed here is in the pattern:
​
1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 3, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4,  and so on.

Formula For Triangular Number Sequence
Triangular numbers correspond to the first-degree case of Faulhaber’s formula.
