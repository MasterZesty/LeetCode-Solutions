**Let's break down those conditions:
​
if s[i] not in visited: - This condition checks if we haven't seen the current letter s[i] before. If we have already seen it, there's no need to process it again.
​
while (stack and stack[-1] > s[i] and last_occ[stack[-1]] > i): - This condition is a bit more complex, but it's crucial for removing duplicates correctly.
​
stack checks if there are letters in our stack. If it's empty, we don't need to do anything.
stack[-1] > s[i] checks if the last letter on the stack (the top block) is greater (comes later in the alphabet) than the current letter s[i]. If it's greater, we want to remove it because we want to keep the smallest letters.
last_occ[stack[-1]] > i checks if we will see that last letter on the stack again in the future. If we will see it again, we shouldn't remove it just yet; we should keep it.
So, these conditions ensure that we only remove letters from the stack when it's safe to do so. It's like playing with building blocks: we only take a block off the stack if it's the right time, and we want to keep the smallest blocks at the top.
​
These conditions help the code maintain the order of the letters while removing duplicates, which is essential to get the correct result.**
