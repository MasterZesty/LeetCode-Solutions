Imagine you have a lot of buckets, and you want to find out which one has something special inside (like candy or a toy). To do this, you have some pigs that can help you. Each pig can do a certain number of tests.
​
The tests_per_pig tells you how many tests one pig can do. For example, if it takes 15 minutes for something to die in a bucket, and you have 15 minutes to test, then one pig can do 1 test because they have just enough time for one.
​
Now, let's say you have many buckets, and you want to make sure your pigs can check all of them. You want to know how many pigs you need. The pigs variable is how many pigs you're using.
​
The line tests_per_pig ** pigs is like saying "how many tests all the pigs together can do." For example, if you have 2 pigs, and each can do 1 test, then tests_per_pig ** pigs would be 2 ** 2, which is 4. It means both pigs together can do 4 tests in total.
​
The code checks if this total number of tests is less than the number of buckets you have. If it is, it means your pigs can't test all the buckets, so you need more pigs. So you keep adding pigs (increasing the pigs variable) until you have enough tests to cover all the buckets.
​
The idea is to use as few pigs as possible while still being able to test all the buckets, and that's what this code is trying to figure out.
​
----------------------------------------------
​
The addition of 1 to minutesToTest // minutesToDie is used to account for the initial test that does not require a pig to die. Let me explain it further:
​
In this scenario, you have two time intervals: minutesToDie, which is the time it takes for a pig to die after consuming poison, and minutesToTest, which is the total time available for testing before a pig dies.
​
The division minutesToTest // minutesToDie calculates how many time intervals (tests) you can perform within the given time frame. However, it's important to consider that you can also perform an initial test without sacrificing a pig's life. That initial test allows you to gather some information before using a pig's death as an indicator.
​
So, you add 1 to minutesToTest // minutesToDie to account for this initial test, which doesn't consume a pig's life but still contributes to the information you gather. This additional test helps you make the most efficient use of your pigs in finding the poisoned bucket.
