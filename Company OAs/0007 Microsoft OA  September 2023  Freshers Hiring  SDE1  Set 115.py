Challenge 1 description

A patient needs rehabilitation within the next N days (numbered from O to N-1). The
rehabilitation consists of X sessions. For every rehabilitation session, other than the
last one, the next session is exactly Y days later.

You are given an array A of N integers listing the costs of the individual rehabilitation
sessions on the N days: that is rehabilitation on the K-th day costs A[KJ.

Write a function:
int solution(int A[], int N, int X, int Y);

that, given the array A and the two integers X and Y, retums the minimum of
rehabilitation.

It is guaranteed that it is always possible to cornplete all X rehabilitation sÃ¦sions.

1. Given A = [4, 2, 3, 7], X = 2 and Y = 2, function should return 7, which is the sum
of the costs on days O and 2 (7 = 4 + 3).

2. Given A = [10, 3, 4, 7], X = 2 and Y = 3, your function should retum 17
rehabilitation is psible only on days O and 3 (17 = 10 + 7).

3. Given A = [4, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5, 1, 4, 2, 7], X = 3 Y = 2, your functim should return 6
which is the sum of the costs on days 4, 6 and 8 (6 = 3 + 1 + 2).

***  Solution/Approch  ***

we are given an array of size n. we have to
pick x elements at exactly y distance; sum of
them should be minimum.

## Apporch 1 : Brute force

ans = floor('inf')
for i in range(n):

    j = i # start at i index and jumps - to y distnace
    sum = 0 # stores sum for that iteration
    c = 0 #to keep track of jumps we need to jump exactly x times

    while ( j >= 1 and c < x):
        sum += A[j]
        c += 1
        j -= y #jump to y distnace

    if c==x:
        ans = min(ans,sum)

return ans

TC : O(n^2)
SC : O(1)

## Approch 2 : Prefix array/ precomputeation

prefix[i] = b[i - 0y] + b[i - 1y] + b[i -2y] +  ..... b[]

prefix[i] = b[i] + prefix[i - y]

ans[i] = prefix[i] - prefix[i - x*y] -> sum of x numbers from index i at distnace y

final ans => min(ans[0],ams[1],ans[2],....ans[i])

TC : O(n)
SP : O(1)
